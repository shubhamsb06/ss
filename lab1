a) Shell script that accepts two file names as arguments, checks if the permissions for these
files are identical and if the permissions are identical, outputs the common permissions,
otherwise outputs each file name followed by its permissions.
if [ $# != 2 ]
then
echo "Invalid input!!!"
else
p1=`ls -l $1|cut -d " " -f1`
p2=`ls -l $2|cut -d " " -f1`
if [ $p1 == $p2 ]
then
echo "the file permissions are same and it is : "
echo "$p1"
else
echo "The file permissions are different"
echo "$1 : $p1"
echo "$2 : $p2"
fi
fi

OUTPUT
command to create the file vi pgm9.sh
use ls -l command to get list of files and their permission
Use chmod 777 pgmname to change permissions
command to execute ./9a.sh filename1 filename2

Pgm 9b :
C program that creates a child process to read commands from the standard input and execute them
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int ch,rv;
char cmd[10];
rv=fork();
if(rv==0)
{
do
{
printf("\nEnter a command\n");
scanf("%s",cmd);
system(cmd);
printf("\n1 : continue\n0 : exit\n");
scanf("%d",&ch);
}
while(ch!=0);
}
else
{
wait(0);
printf("\nChild terminated\n");
}
return 0;
}

output
use the same online editor.
Command to write pgm in online editor : vi pgm9b.c or u can upload file directly
command to execute c file(C compiler) : gcc pgm9b.c
clear error if any, warnings are ok
